    <h1>About the problem :</h1>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size:20px;">
        There exists 3 Towers, numbered 1, 2 and 3 respectively.<br>
        First Tower contain <strong>N</strong> disks, where the disks are placed in decreasing order, starting from the bottom. For example: <br> 
            <pre>
    |           |           |
   *1*          |           |
  **2**         |           | 
---------   ---------   ---------</pre>
        </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;">
        Your <l style="color:green;">goal</l> is to move all disks from the first tower (1) to the last tower (3), you can use the middle tower (2) as a transit tower, but you need to obey the <strong>Rules</strong>.
        </li>
        <li style="font-size:16px;">
        Rules:
            <ul>
                <li>Move only <l style="color:red">one</l> disk at a time.
                </li>
                <li>You cannot Place a disk with size <strong>n</strong>, on top of a disk with size <strong>m</strong>, where <l style="color:red">m > n</l>.
                <br>i.e You cannot place a big disk on a smaller one.
                </li>
                <li>There wont exists 2 disks <Strong>a</strong>,  <Strong>b</strong> where <br><l style="color:red">SizeOf(<Strong> a </strong>) </l>== <l style="color:red">SizeOf(<Strong> b </strong>) </l>.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p style="font-size:16px;">This repository, contains the solution for Tower of Hanoi recursively and Itertively.</p>
    <p style="font-size:15px;">I will be explaining my attempt for the iterative solution.</p>
    <div>
    First, without lost of generality, lets assume that the number of disks is 3. And each disk is represented with a alphabetic character, such as the smallest disk start with <strong>A</strong><br>
    <pre>disk 1 => A
disk 2 => B
disk 3 => C</pre>
    We will initialize a variable to represent the number of moves done till now<pre>move_counter = 0;</pre> 
    Now we will convert this move_counter into <var>base-2</var>, and include 3 bits
    <pre>move_counter ==binary==> 000</pre>
    Here the magic begins,
    lets associate each bit to a disk, starting from the right most bit with the smallest disk.
    <pre>
    0      0       0
    |      |       |
    C      B       A</pre>
    </div>
    Now we start incrementing <var>move_counter</var> till we reach 2^n - 1, which is the Max number represented with 3 bits.
    <pre>move_counter += 1;
// In base 2 
    0       0       1
</pre>
    First rule, Each bit, that changes from 0 to 1, mean that we need to move the disk associated with that bit. To know the number of moves for disk A - and only for A - we investigate if the number of disks is even or not.<br>
    In this case, number of disks = 3 (odd), thus we move 2 steps to the right,
    if the number of disks was even then we only move 1 step to the right.<br>
    After we moved disk <strong>A</strong> to the right 2 steps, this is the state of the towers.
    <pre>
    |                   |                   |
  **2**                 |                   |
 ***3***                |                  *1*
_________           _________           _________
    </pre>
    Now we re increment <var>move_counter</var> by 1.
    <pre>move_counter += 1; // moves_counter = 2
// In base 2 
    0       1       0
</pre>
    Bit 1 changed from 1 to 0, we dont do anything about disk A, however, bit 2 changed from 0 to 1, thus we move disk <strong>B</strong>. Note that only disk A moves 2 (odd) steps or 1 (even) step, all other disk moves to the available tower respectively, thus we need to move disk  <strong>B</strong> to the first available tower, which is tower (2).
        <pre>
    |                   |                   |
    |                   |                   |
 ***3***              **2**                *1*
_________           _________           _________
    </pre>
    Now we re increment <var>move_counter</var> by 1.
    <pre>move_counter += 1; // moves_counter = 3
// In base 2 
    0       1       1
</pre>
Bit 1 changed from 0 to 1,thus we need to move disk  <strong>A</strong> two steps to the right, i.e to tower (2).
        <pre>
    |                   |                   |
    |                  *1*                  |
 ***3***              **2**                 |
_________           _________           _________
    </pre>
    This algorithm continues till move_counter reaches 2^n - 1.
    <br>
    I will put the moves without explaining.
        <pre>
// move_counter = 4           =>  1 0 0
    |                   |                   |
    |                  *1*                  |
    |                 **2**              ***3***
_________           _________           _________
    </pre>
        <pre>
// move_counter = 5           =>  1 0 1
    |                   |                   |
    |                   |                   |
   *1*                **2**              ***3***
_________           _________           _________
    </pre>
            <pre>
// move_counter = 6           =>  1 1 0
    |                   |                   |
    |                   |                 **2**
   *1*                  |                ***3***
_________           _________           _________
    </pre>
            <pre>
// move_counter = 7           =>  1 1 1
    |                   |                  *1*
    |                   |                 **2**
    |                   |                ***3***
_________           _________           _________
    </pre>
    Done.
